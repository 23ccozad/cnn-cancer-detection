# CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Challenge
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to create various neural networks trained to classify images of tumor tissue as cancerous or non-cancerous. The data came from the [Histopathologic Cancer Detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection) on Kaggle. This served as the assignment for week 3 in DTSA 5511: Introduction to Deep Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder.
